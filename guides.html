                Often, typefaces are designed with an intended usage in mind —
                they're optimized for display usage (larger headings), or text
                (smaller body copy etc.) In general, text type is designed to be
                legible and readable at small sizes.
              </p>
              <p class="often-typefaces-are">
                Don't worry, you don't necessarily need to choose a separate
                typeface for display and text. Many typefaces can be used for
                both. Inter is a great example — it's clean, consistent, and
                uncomplicated design features make it suitable for use at all
                sizes.
              </p>
              <p class="often-typefaces-are">
                However, if you're using the same typeface for both body text
                and display test, it is often a good idea to tweak letter
                spacing to the display text style to make it more legible in
                larger sizing. Don't go overboard though, a little goes a long
                way and helps display text look and feel tighter.

                Unfortunately, Figma only allows you to define a % value for
                letter spacing in text styles, which doesn't mirror CSS. If
                you're handing designs to a developer or building a design
                yourself, you'll need to define a either a hard-pixel value or a
                rem/em value (e.g. -0.1em).
